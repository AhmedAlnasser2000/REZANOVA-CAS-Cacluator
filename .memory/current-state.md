# Current State

## Active Context
- Workspace: `Calcwiz`
- Active branch context: `main` with local milestone commits and no upstream configured yet in this workspace.
- Workflow default: commit-first with meaningful verified gates and explicit approval before commit or push.

## Current Product Phase
- Post harmonization pass for the three guided cores:
  - Geometry
  - Trigonometry
  - Statistics
- Post initial launcher/category and top-panel Guide consolidation.
- Post workflow and memory infrastructure overhaul to Memory V2.
- Track `R` decomposition sweep is closed and regression-verified.

## Stable Architecture Snapshot
- Desktop-first calculator with Tauri shell and React/TypeScript frontend.
- MathLive-backed textbook-style editing.
- Mode separation is intentional:
  - `Calculate` for general scalar/expression evaluation
  - `Equation` for solve workflows
  - domain cores for Geometry, Trigonometry, and Statistics
- Geometry, Trigonometry, and Statistics use the shared core-mode pattern:
  - one top executable draft/editor
  - guided menus and forms below
  - explicit transfers instead of implicit fallback into `Calculate`
- Guide is a top-panel utility, not a launcher app.
- Active runtime shell:
  - `src/App.tsx` is now the import shell (`App.css` + `AppMain`)
  - `src/AppMain.tsx` hosts orchestration/runtime rendering
  - `src/App.css` remains the import manifest over `src/styles/app/*`
- Extracted `src/app/*`, `src/styles/app/*`, and decomposition facades under solver/guide/types are in-tree and passing regression.

## Most Recent Completed Milestone
- Completed Track `C` milestone `P2`:
  - Added deferred Geometry inverse solve-missing families for cone, cuboid, arc-sector, and Heron one-side workflows.
  - Added bounded `lineEquation(...)` one-unknown + one-constraint parsing/routing to existing coordinate solve-missing engines.
  - Added explicit handoff mapping warning for unresolved-but-eligible coordinate sends (`x` placeholder mapping).
  - Added P2 template seeds in Geometry workspace and updated Geometry route/help + guide copy.
- Regression checks:
  - `npm test -- --run`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `cargo check`

## Recent Verified Context
- Solver-side and type/content decomposition work from Track `R` is present under:
  - `src/lib/equation/{substitution,guarded}/*`
  - `src/lib/trigonometry/rewrite/*`
  - `src/lib/guide/content/*`
  - `src/types/calculator/*`
- App shell imports now resolve through `src/App.tsx` -> `src/AppMain.tsx` with shared styles via `src/App.css`.

## Current Known Risks
- `src/AppMain.tsx` remains large; further decomposition should continue behind strict parity gates.
- Local-minimum numeric recovery thresholds may need tuning on edge functions with shallow minima.
- Some Compute Engine rule checks still print noisy stderr warnings during tests, even though assertions pass.
- Broader log transforms (`ln(u)-ln(v)`, ratio/power forms) remain intentionally out of bounded scope and should keep explicit unsupported messaging.
- Bounded trig sum-to-product currently covers two-term `sin/cos` forms only; broader harmonic families remain deferred.

## Pending Verification
- Optional desktop smoke pass on the current shell wiring for visual parity confidence beyond automated coverage.
- Keep the Track E manual checklist in parallel:
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-E-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
- Track C checklist artifacts:
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-C-P0-P1-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-C-P2-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`

## Next Recommended Task
- Continue with Track C `P3` planning/implementation after user review of P2 behavior and checklist confirmation.
