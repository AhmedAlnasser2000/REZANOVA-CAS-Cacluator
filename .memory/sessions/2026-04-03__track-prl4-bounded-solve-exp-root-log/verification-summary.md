## Automated Gate
- `npm run test:gate`

## Focused Coverage Added / Updated
- `src/lib/equation/substitution-solve.test.ts`
  - same-base equality families
  - same-base log quotient preprocessing
  - bounded mixed-base log exact/unresolved branches
- `src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts`
  - exact result and supplement propagation for the new PRL4 solve families
- `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts`
  - guarded backend parity for bounded log/root/power solve expansion
- `src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
  - Equation-mode PRL4 solve outcomes and provenance
- `src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
  - visible condition lines and badges for same-base, mixed-base, and power-lift cases
- `e2e/qa1-smoke.spec.ts`
  - same-base logarithmic equality
  - bounded mixed-base exact solve
  - recognized mixed-base numeric-guidance stop
  - bounded rational-power solve

## Outcome
- Passed

## Notes
- Gate still prints the previously known Compute Engine stderr noise in some trig tests, but assertions passed.
- Playwright smoke assertions were tightened to scope badge checks to the visible result badge row and to tolerate the rendered minus glyph in condition text.
