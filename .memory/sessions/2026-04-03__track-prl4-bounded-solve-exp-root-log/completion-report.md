## Delivered
- Added bounded same-base equality solving for exponential, natural-log, and explicit-base log equations.
- Added equation-side same-base log quotient preprocessing and bounded mixed-base log normalization when change-of-base coefficients can be cleared exactly.
- Added bounded two-sided radical/rational-power isolation with one safe lift before guarded recursion.
- Preserved explicit numeric guidance for recognized mixed-base families that still fall outside bounded exact symbolic support.
- Preserved exact symbolic branch output and merged condition supplements through the new guarded solve paths.

## Notes
- `PRL4` is still real-domain only and Equation-first.
- `Calculate` did not gain the broader log-difference/quotient simplify rules in this milestone.
- Variable log bases, Lambert W families, unrestricted log identities, and general nested-radical solving remain deferred.
