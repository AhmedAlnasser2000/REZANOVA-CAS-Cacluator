## Task
- Finish Refactor Track `R` multi-file decomposition sweep under strict no-behavior-change rules.

## What Changed
- `R0` safety baseline:
  - solver characterization tests in `src/lib/equation/solver-parity.contract.test.ts`
  - guide characterization tests in `src/lib/guide/content.contract.test.ts`
  - manual verification artifact `.memory/research/REFACTOR-R0-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
- `R1` presentation extraction:
  - workspace rendering moved into `src/app/workspaces/*`
  - preview rendering helper moved into `src/app/components/GeneratedPreviewCard.tsx`
- `R2` action routing extraction:
  - `expressionRouting.ts`
  - `primaryActionRouter.ts`
  - `softActionRouter.ts`
  - `keypadRouter.ts`
- `R3` focus/reset/guide/app-flow extraction:
  - `focusRouting.ts`
  - `modeGuideRouting.ts`
  - `modeReset.ts`
  - `appFlowHandlers.ts`
- `R4` CSS decomposition:
  - `src/App.css` reduced to import manifest
  - styles split into `src/styles/app/*`
- `R5` solver decomposition:
  - `src/lib/equation/substitution/*`
  - `src/lib/equation/guarded/*`
  - `src/lib/trigonometry/rewrite/*`
  - compatibility wrappers preserved at existing entrypoints
- `R6` guide content decomposition:
  - `src/lib/guide/content/*`
  - stable facade kept at `src/lib/guide/content.ts`
- `R7` calculator type decomposition:
  - `src/types/calculator/*`
  - stable facade kept at `src/types/calculator.ts`
- Added remaining manual verification artifacts:
  - `.memory/research/REFACTOR-R1-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/REFACTOR-R2-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/REFACTOR-R3-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/REFACTOR-R4-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/REFACTOR-R5-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/REFACTOR-R6-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/REFACTOR-R7-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
- Removed leftover temporary range-debug files from the repo root.

## Outcome
- Track `R` is complete.
- `src/App.tsx` is now the import shell (`App.css` + `AppMain`), keeping the target file below the `<= 4000` threshold.
- Runtime orchestration currently resides in `src/AppMain.tsx` (`9394` lines after the latest utility extraction pass).
- `src/App.css` line count is now `11`.
- The public import surface for solver, guide, and calculator types is preserved despite internal decomposition.

## Follow-up
- Track `R` manual checklists (`R0` through `R7`) are now filled with pass notes tied to the 2026-03-06 regression gate.
- Any future cleanup beyond this track should be optional typing tightening or localized polish, not more required structural extraction.
