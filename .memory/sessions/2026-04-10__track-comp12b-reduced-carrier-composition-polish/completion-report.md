## Task Goal
- Implement `COMP12B` as the polish slice for `COMP12A`: clean up reduced-carrier periodic/sawtooth readback, sharpen guided-stop explanations, differentiate exact reduced-carrier context from stop messaging in the result card, and improve composition-aware guidance wording without widening the solving surface.

## What Changed
- Polished `src/lib/equation/composition-stage.ts` so exact reduced-carrier periodic and sawtooth outcomes now use canonical exact-summary language instead of layered stop-like summaries.
- Added reduced-carrier guidance classification so guided composition outcomes now distinguish:
  - mixed reduced-carrier boundaries
  - higher-degree reduced-polynomial boundaries
  - continuations that leave the current bounded exact sink set
  - the existing multi-parameter / depth-cap / sawtooth boundary classes already surfaced through structured periodic metadata
- Kept explicit `x` closure preferred and left the `COMP12A` exact/guided capability boundary unchanged.
- Polished `src/AppMain.tsx` so periodic-family result cards now separate:
  - exact reduced-carrier context (`Reduced Carrier`)
  - exact-closure boundary messaging (`Exact Closure Boundary`)
  instead of treating both as one combined reduction-note surface.
- Updated focused regression coverage in:
  - `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
  - `src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- Added a manual verification checklist at `.memory/research/TRACK-COMP12B-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`.

## Verification
- `npm run test:unit -- src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts`
- `npm run test:ui -- src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- `npm run lint -- src/lib/equation/composition-stage.ts src/AppMain.tsx src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- `npm run test:memory-protocol`
- `npm run test:gate`

## Verification Notes
- The first `npm run test:gate` attempt timed out at the shell level before completion; rerunning with a longer timeout completed cleanly with all checks passing.
- The only implementation wobble during verification was a UI test assumption that guided mixed-carrier composition cases would render a reduced-carrier block. The final contract keeps those cases guided with improved summary/error context, representative periodic metadata, and no exact reduced-carrier block.

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether the next capability slice should move to `ABS5A` or continue the composition lane as `COMP13A` now that `COMP12A`/`COMP12B` are both in place.
