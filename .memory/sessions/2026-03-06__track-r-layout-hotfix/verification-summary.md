## Runtime Reproduction
- Reproduced the broken layout in a live browser run after the user report.
- Confirmed the fix visually after the patch: workspace content is visible again outside the display shell.
- Reproduced an additional severe regression from `rec import.mp4`: blank top display shell in core modes caused by missing editor/result render paths in extracted `App.tsx` shape.
- Verified emergency rollback recovery by restoring `src/App.tsx` and `src/App.css` to `dd126ac` and re-running automated checks.

## Automated Gate
- `npm run build` : PASS
- `npm test -- --run` : PASS
- `npm run tauri:dev` : BLOCKED (port `1420` already in use, no compile regression observed before port check)

## Notes
- Test output still includes the existing Compute Engine stderr warnings seen in prior gates; assertions remain green.
- Solver behavior remained untouched in this hotfix; recovery was app-shell wiring only.
