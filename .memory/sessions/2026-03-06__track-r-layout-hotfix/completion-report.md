## Task
- Repair the Track `R` runtime layout regression that left workbench content effectively invisible after the multi-file extraction.

## What Changed
- Identified that the extracted workspace components in `src/App.tsx` were mounted inside the `display-editor` / display-shell tree instead of below it.
- Restored the correct render structure by closing the display shell before the extracted workspace render calls.
- Reproduced the broken layout from the user recording in a live browser run and visually confirmed the repaired layout after the patch.

## Outcome
- The workspace area is visible again.
- The extracted workspaces now render in the main workbench region rather than being collapsed inside the LCD card.
- Track `R` remains structurally complete; this hotfix corrects the runtime render tree only.

## Follow-up
- Run the Track `R` manual checklists when convenient.
- Do not start new refactor slicing from this broken intermediate shape; the fixed `App.tsx` tree is now the valid baseline.
- 2026-03-06 follow-on: after deeper user-recorded reproduction (`rec import.mp4`), applied an emergency rollback of `src/App.tsx` + `src/App.css` to stable commit `dd126ac` because the extracted shell still had missing top-editor/result wiring that made core modes effectively unusable.
