## Commit
- commit_hash: recorded in the current `HEAD` checkpoint for this verified milestone

## Scope
- `PGL5` user-owned SSH VM pilot
- remote `ssh`/`scp` orchestration in the Playground external-compute lane
- pulled-back artifact parsing and parity reporting
- roadmap, record, and memory capture for the new pilot

## Gate
- backend

## Commands
- `npm run test:playground`
- `npx eslint eslint.config.js src playground`
- `npm run test:memory-protocol`

## Manual Checks
- Live operator-side backend gate on `calcwiz-box` completed successfully.
- Pulled-back local `artifact-manifest.json` recorded `status: completed`.
- Pulled-back local `parity-report.json` recorded `resultClass: match`.

## Outcome
- Passed.
- Passed again after the post-commit follow-up fix to the remote `npm exec -- vitest` invocation.
- Passed again after widening the remote SSH entrypoint test timeout to `30_000ms` for live-VM execution.

## Outstanding Gaps
- The automated suite verifies the SSH pilot through mocked command execution rather than a live VM run.
- The live VM gate is now proven on one user-owned SSH target only; provider/rented-host follow-up remains a later sequencing decision.
