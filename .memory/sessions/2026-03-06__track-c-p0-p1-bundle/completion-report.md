## Task Goal
- Deliver Track C bundle `P0 + P1`:
  - `P0` stabilization parity gate
  - `P1` Geometry bounded solve-missing milestone with `?` marker and strict one-unknown policy

## What Changed
- Extended Geometry request types with solve-missing variants for all in-scope P1 families.
- Added parser support for solve-missing structured/shorthand requests with strict one-unknown enforcement.
- Added Geometry core solve-missing execution handlers for:
  - square, circle, cube, sphere, triangle area, rectangle, cylinder
  - distance, midpoint, slope
- Added unresolved-but-eligible coordinate equation handoff action support.
- Added Geometry workspace template seed actions for solve-missing request drafts.
- Added/extended Geometry tests for parser/core/navigation coverage of P1 behavior.
- Added `pi` normalization in Geometry scalar resolver for relation values like `10*pi`.
- Added Track C P0/P1 manual verification checklist artifact.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --run src/lib/geometry/core.test.ts src/lib/geometry/parser.test.ts src/lib/geometry/navigation.test.ts`
- `npm test -- --run`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `cargo check`

## Commits
- Pending explicit user approval.

## Follow-Ups
- Run a live desktop manual smoke sweep if UI parity confirmation is required beyond automated test coverage.
- Continue with Track C next milestone scope after user confirms P0/P1 closure.
