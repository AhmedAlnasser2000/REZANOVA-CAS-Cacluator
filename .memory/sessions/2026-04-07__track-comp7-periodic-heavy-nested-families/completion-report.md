## Delivered
- Added explicit `periodicReductionDepth` tracking so nested periodic composition may reduce one structured layer farther before stopping.
- Strengthened bounded pruning for trig-over-trig and reciprocal-over-trig composition families by preserving discovered-family trails and pruning against proven images before the next periodic step.
- Extended deep periodic structured stops with reduced-carrier notes, discovered-family output, and specific stop reasons for multi-parameter, depth-cap, and unmerged-branch cases.
- Kept inverse/direct trig scope frozen at `COMP6`; deeper sawtooth-style closure still stops with structured guidance.

## Main Files
- `src/lib/equation/composition-stage.ts`
- `src/lib/equation/guarded/merge.ts`
- `src/types/calculator/runtime-types.ts`
- `src/AppMain.tsx`
- `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts`
- `src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- `e2e/qa1-smoke.spec.ts`

## Notes
- `COMP7` is Equation-only and still bounded to finite exact branches or a single periodic parameter `k ∈ Z`.
- Deep periodic cases such as `sin(cos(tan(x))) = c` now reduce farther and explain exactly why exact closure stops when a second periodic parameter would be required.
