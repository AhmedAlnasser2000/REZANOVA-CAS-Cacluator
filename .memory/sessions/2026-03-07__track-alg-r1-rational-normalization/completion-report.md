## Task Goal
- Deliver the first Exact Algebra Core milestone as bounded exact rational normalization for `Calculate` and `Equation`.

## What Changed
- Added `src/lib/symbolic-engine/rational.ts` to detect and normalize bounded single-variable exact rational expressions.
- Routed `Calculate > Simplify` through the rational engine for supported exact rational expressions, including fraction combine and safe cancellation.
- Routed `Calculate > Factor` through the rational engine for supported exact rational expressions, factoring numerator and denominator separately without cancellation.
- Added a rational normalization stage in guarded equation solving so supported rational equations are normalized before solve and denominator exclusions are preserved.
- Added exact-result supplement rendering so exclusions appear as a second exact line in the result area.
- Added targeted rational tests and extended math-engine/equation/shared-solve coverage.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --run`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `cargo check`

## Commits
- Pending explicit user approval.

## Follow-Ups
- Run `.memory/research/TRACK-ALG-R1-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md` in app and append pass/fail notes.
- Decide whether to commit this bounded rational-normalization gate before planning the next algebra milestone.
