## Task Goal
- Implement `PGL3` as the first real Playground pilot for `sym-search-planner-ordering`: add a replayable guarded-stage ordering seam, build a dedicated Playground Vitest lab, run the fixed 12-case corpus against three planner orderings, and update the experiment record with a promotion decision.

## Gate
- backend

## What Changed
- Added an export-only guarded solver replay seam in `src/lib/equation/guarded/run.ts`:
  - `runGuardedEquationSolveWithStageOrder(request, stageOrder)`
  - exact-permutation validation for custom stage orderings
  - recursive reuse of the chosen ordering
  - compact stage-attempt trace output
- Rewired recursive guarded stages to use the injected runner instead of hardcoding the default host runner, while keeping `runGuardedEquationSolve()` behavior unchanged.
- Added focused seam coverage in `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts` for:
  - default-order replay parity
  - invalid custom-order rejection
  - recursive trace reuse of the chosen ordering
- Added a dedicated Playground lab harness:
  - `vitest.playground.config.ts`
  - `npm run test:playground`
  - `playground/level-0-research/symbolic-search/*`
- Locked the `PGL3` experiment to a fixed 12-case symbolic corpus and three planner orderings:
  - `baseline-default`
  - `recursive-first`
  - `trig-rewrite-first`
- Ran the lab and wrote the actual evidence back into the authoritative Playground record and manifest.
- Result:
  - no alternate ordering produced an exact improvement
  - both alternates produced the same honesty regression on `2^{|sin(x^5+x)|}=2^{1/2}`
  - `recursive-first` found two cleaner trace-only wins, but still failed promotion because of the honesty regression
  - `sym-search-planner-ordering` remains at `level-0-research`

## Verification
- `npm run test:playground`
- `npm run test:unit`
- `npx eslint eslint.config.js src playground`
- `npm run test:memory-protocol`

## Verification Notes
- `PGL3` is a non-product Playground milestone: no stable app behavior or default guarded solver ordering changed.
- The dedicated lab is now executable and reproducible, and the experiment record reflects the real first-run result rather than seeded placeholder text.

## Commits
- Recorded in the current `HEAD` checkpoint with message `chore(playground): add symbolic search lab`.

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether the next incubation pass should narrow to guardrail-preserving intra-stage heuristics around composition/algebra-transform, or retire whole-stage planner-order experiments and choose a different Playground pilot.
