# COMP4 Completion Report

- Gate: `backend`
- Status: verified, not committed

## Delivered
- Added bounded parameterized periodic follow-on solving for affine carriers and pure power-form carriers `(ax+b)^n` with integer `n` from `2` to `6`.
- Added bounded inverse-trig outer inversion for `\arcsin`, `\arccos`, and `\arctan`, including unit-aware principal-range checks and one supported follow-on handoff.
- Extended periodic-family result metadata with parameter constraints, representative branches, and filtered interval suggestions.
- Preserved real-domain honesty for even-power branches and broader nonlinear carriers, which now stop with structured guidance instead of fake symbolic closure.
- Fixed inverse-trig angle-unit consistency in Compute Engine-backed evaluation so guarded candidate validation respects `RAD`, `DEG`, and `GRAD`.

## Notes
- `COMP4` stays Equation-first and real-domain only.
- Parameterized carrier solving is intentionally limited to affine and pure power-form carriers; broader polynomial-in-`k` follow-on remains out of scope.
- Inverse-trig expansion is bounded to one outer inversion plus one supported downstream handoff.
