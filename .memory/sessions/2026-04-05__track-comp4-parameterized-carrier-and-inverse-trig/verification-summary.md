# COMP4 Verification Summary

## Automated Gate
- `npm run test:gate`

## Focused Coverage Added / Updated
- `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts`
  - parameterized periodic-family success for `\sin(x^2)=1/2`
  - power-form periodic-family success for `\sin((2x+1)^3)=0`
  - even-power branch filtering with parameter constraints
  - bounded inverse-trig handoff for `\arcsin(2x-1)=30`
  - bounded inverse-trig handoff for `\arctan(\ln(x+1))=45`
  - recognized-but-unresolved broader nonlinear carrier `\sin(x^2+x)=1/2`
- `src/lib/math-engine.test.ts`
  - inverse-trig output respects selected `RAD`, `DEG`, and `GRAD`
- `src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
  - parameterized family sections render in Equation results
  - inverse-trig follow-on results render with structured badges and supplements
  - broader nonlinear carriers stay structured and unresolved
- `e2e/qa1-smoke.spec.ts`
  - parameterized periodic-family smoke
  - inverse-trig follow-on smoke
  - unresolved broader nonlinear carrier smoke

## Outcome
- Passed

## Notes
- The full repo gate passed after adding parameterized carrier solving, bounded inverse-trig handoff, and unit-aware inverse-trig evaluation fixes.
- Some pre-existing Compute Engine stderr noise still appears in a few trig-heavy tests, but assertions passed and the gate is green.
