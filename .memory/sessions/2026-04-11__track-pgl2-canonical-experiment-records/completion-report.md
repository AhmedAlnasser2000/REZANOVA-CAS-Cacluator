## Task Goal
- Implement `PGL2` as the governance layer that makes Playground experiments reviewable, comparable, and promotable: make records canonical, add shared checklists, add tiny YAML companion manifests, add a records index, and seed one real symbolic-search starter experiment without adding automation or runtime behavior.

## Gate
- backend

## What Changed
- Upgraded `playground/templates/experiment-record-template.md` into the canonical Markdown record template with explicit metadata for:
  - `experiment_id`
  - `title`
  - `owner`
  - `lane_topic`
  - `current_level`
  - `status`
  - `date_started`
  - `last_reviewed`
  - `next_review`
  - `candidate_stable_home`
  - `companion_manifest`
- Added shared checklist templates:
  - `playground/templates/promotion-checklist-template.md`
  - `playground/templates/retirement-checklist-template.md`
- Added a tiny companion manifest template at `playground/templates/experiment-manifest-template.yaml`.
- Added a human-readable records index at `playground/records/INDEX.md`.
- Seeded the first real experiment:
  - record: `playground/records/sym-search-planner-ordering.md`
  - manifest: `playground/manifests/sym-search-planner-ordering.yaml`
  - lane: `symbolic-search`
  - level: `level-0-research`
  - status: `draft`
- Tightened Playground docs so they now state:
  - Markdown is the authoritative record
  - YAML is a companion summary only
  - every real experiment should have a record + manifest + index entry
  - Playground still does not include automation, schema validation, or execution infrastructure
- Updated durable memory so `PGL2` is now the canonical record-governance milestone and the next real sequencing question is whether to begin `PGL3` immediately with the seeded symbolic-search starter.

## Verification
- `npx eslint eslint.config.js src`
- `npm run test:memory-protocol`

## Verification Notes
- This was a governance-only milestone. No runtime behavior changed.
- The existing `PGL1` import fence remains unchanged and still passes after the new docs/templates/records were added.

## Commits
- Recorded in the current `HEAD` checkpoint with message `chore(playground): add canonical experiment records`.

## Memory Updated
- `.memory/current-state.md`
- `.memory/decisions.md`
- `.memory/open-questions.md`
- `.memory/journal/2026-04-11.md`
- `.memory/sessions/2026-04-11__track-pgl2-canonical-experiment-records/completion-report.md`
- `.memory/sessions/2026-04-11__track-pgl2-canonical-experiment-records/verification-summary.md`
- `.memory/sessions/2026-04-11__track-pgl2-canonical-experiment-records/commit-log.md`

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether to start `PGL3` immediately with `sym-search-planner-ordering` as the first real pilot.
