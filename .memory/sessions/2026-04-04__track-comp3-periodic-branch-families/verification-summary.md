## Automated Gate
- `npm run test:gate`

## Focused Coverage Added / Updated
- `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts`
  - periodic family success for `\ln(\sin x)=0`
  - finite-image trig composition family solving for `\sin(\cos x)=1/2`
  - exact periodic follow-on for `\tan(\ln(x+1))=1`
  - exact periodic exponential follow-on for `\sin(e^x)=1/2`
  - structured periodic guidance for nonlinear-in-`k` carriers such as `\sin(x^2)=1/2`
  - non-radian family formatting in `DEG`
- `src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
  - periodic family sections render in Equation success/error states
  - tan-log periodic families show suggested intervals
  - unresolved periodic guidance stays structured instead of generic
  - non-radian periodic families render as unit-native numeric branches
- `e2e/qa1-smoke.spec.ts`
  - finite periodic composition family smoke
  - unresolved structured periodic guidance smoke
  - tan-log periodic family smoke
  - degree-mode family formatting smoke

## Outcome
- Passed

## Notes
- The full repo gate passed after adding periodic family synthesis, structured result metadata, non-radian family formatting, and branch-aware interval suggestions.
- Existing Compute Engine stderr noise still appears in a few trig-heavy tests, but assertions passed and the gate is green.
