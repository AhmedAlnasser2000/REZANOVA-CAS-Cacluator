## Delivered
- Added periodic trig branch-family synthesis to the guarded composition solver for bounded `sin/cos/tan` follow-on cases.
- Added structured periodic-family result metadata so Equation can show general family latex, representative branches, and suggested numeric intervals.
- Added bounded exact follow-on through supported carriers such as `\ln(\sin x)=0`, `\tan(\ln(x+1))=1`, and `\sin(e^x)=1/2`.
- Kept nonlinear-in-`k` carriers honest by returning structured periodic guidance plus interval suggestions instead of fake exact closure.
- Added unit-aware periodic family formatting for `RAD`, `DEG`, and `GRAD`.

## Notes
- `COMP3` stays Equation-first and real-domain only.
- One periodic parameter `k \in \mathbb{Z}` is introduced.
- Direct periodic families may finish through bounded exact handoff, but nonlinear-in-`k` carrier solves remain out of scope and now stop with structured guidance.
