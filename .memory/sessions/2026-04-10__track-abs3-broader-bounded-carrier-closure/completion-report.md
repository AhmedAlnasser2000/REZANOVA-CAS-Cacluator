## Task Goal
- Implement `ABS3` as the broader bounded carrier-closure milestone on top of `ABS1` and `ABS2`: keep the shared `u=\pm v` branch model fixed, broaden stronger carrier closure only when every branch lands in already-shipped sinks, and improve stronger-carrier unresolved guidance without widening into nested abs or general piecewise search.

## What Changed
- Extended `src/lib/abs-core.ts` so the shared abs substrate now:
  - classifies abs-family carriers internally instead of treating every supported inner expression as the same surface
  - distinguishes ordinary affine abs families from stronger polynomial/radical/rational-power carrier families for unresolved guidance
  - produces stronger-carrier numeric guidance while preserving the existing bounded branch model
- Extended `src/lib/equation/guarded/algebra-stage.ts` so direct and transform-produced abs families reuse family-specific unresolved messaging from the shared abs core instead of the older generic abs-family stop text.
- Tightened transformed-branch validation in `src/lib/equation/guarded/run.ts` so direct symbolic branch results only contribute real candidate roots back into merged exact solve output when the original equation still needs branch/candidate validation.
- Locked the milestone with focused ABS3 regression coverage in:
  - `src/lib/abs-core.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
- Added a manual verification checklist at `.memory/research/TRACK-ABS3-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`.

## Verification
- `npm run test:unit -- src/lib/abs-core.test.ts src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
- `npm run lint -- src/lib/abs-core.ts src/lib/abs-core.test.ts src/lib/equation/guarded/algebra-stage.ts src/lib/equation/guarded/run.ts src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
- `npm run test:gate`

## Verification Notes
- `ABS3` closed cleanly under the existing shared abs/branch substrate; no new abs-specific flake or unresolved blocker was observed during the full gate.

## Commits
- Recorded in repository history as the same ABS3 checkpoint that updated this dossier.

## Memory Updated

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether the next algebra step should stay in the abs lane as `ABS4` or return to the composition lane now that stronger abs carriers reuse the same shared branch model cleanly.
