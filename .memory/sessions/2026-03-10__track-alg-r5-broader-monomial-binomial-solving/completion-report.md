## Scope
- Implement Exact Algebra Core `R5`
- Broaden bounded rational/radical equation solving from the shipped `R3` surface to one-variable monomial/binomial families
- Keep existing `R4` transform UX unchanged while widening eligibility and solve reach

## Implemented
- Extended rational-family support from affine-only factors to one-variable monomial/binomial factors in the symbolic rational engine.
- Extended radical-family support from monomial radicands to one-variable monomial/binomial radicands in the symbolic radical engine.
- Broadened the guarded algebra stage so supported rational equations clear exact LCDs and recurse through the shared solver with original exclusions preserved.
- Added bounded depth-2 square-root transform chaining for supported radical equations.
- Promoted supported square-root-binomial conjugate equations from recognized-only into actual solve paths when the transformed equation stayed inside the bounded surface.
- Preserved and revalidated original exclusions/conditions on all transformed candidates.

## Verification
- `npm run test:gate`
