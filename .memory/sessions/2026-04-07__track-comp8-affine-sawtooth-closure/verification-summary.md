## Automated Gates
- `npm run test:unit -- src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts`
- `npm run test:ui -- --run src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- `npm run build`
- `npx playwright test e2e/qa1-smoke.spec.ts -g "COMP8 smoke"`
- `npm run test:gate`

## Focused Coverage Added / Updated
- `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts`
  - affine sawtooth exact closure for `\arcsin(\sin(2x+10))=30`
  - sign-flipped affine closure for `\arctan(\tan(10-2x))=30`
  - safe outer-inversion handoff into affine sawtooth closure
  - structured nonlinear stop for `\arcsin(\sin(x^2))=\frac{1}{2}`
- `src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
  - piecewise exact sawtooth rendering
  - principal-range supplements for affine closure
  - reduced-carrier structured guidance for non-affine sawtooth cases
- `e2e/qa1-smoke.spec.ts`
  - degree-mode affine sawtooth closure smoke
  - non-affine structured sawtooth-guidance smoke

## Outcome
- Passed

## Notes
- A stale preview build initially made the browser look out of sync with source; a fresh production build restored parity and the full repo gate passed cleanly.
