## Task Goal
- Implement `PGL4` as an external-compute foundations milestone inside Playground: add provider-neutral contracts, a local harness over one real existing workload, JSON runner/job templates, and the required roadmap/record/memory capture without adding real SSH/provider execution.

## Gate
- backend

## What Changed
- Reinterpreted the roadmap meaning of `PGL4` from a vague external-compute pilot into an explicit foundations-only milestone.
- Added `playground/level-0-research/external-compute/` with:
  - provider-neutral runner/job/artifact contracts
  - a workload registry
  - a local harness that writes structured artifacts to `.task_tmp/pgl4-external-compute/`
  - checked-in JSON templates for runner profiles and job specs
  - ignored local `*.local.json` profile support
- Extracted the symbolic-search experiment into a reusable non-test runner so the same real workload can power both the existing `PGL3` lab and the new `PGL4` local harness.
- Added the active experiment record and manifest:
  - `playground/records/ext-compute-ssh-foundations.md`
  - `playground/manifests/ext-compute-ssh-foundations.yaml`
- Added the required manual verification checklist for the finished `PGL3` track:
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-PGL3-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
- Updated Playground roadmap/docs, index files, current-state snapshot, decisions, open question log, and journal notes to reflect the new foundations lane.

## Verification
- `npm run test:playground`
- `npx eslint eslint.config.js src playground`
- `npm run test:memory-protocol`

## Verification Notes
- The real symbolic-search workload executes successfully through the local harness and writes a structured summary plus artifact manifest into `.task_tmp/pgl4-external-compute/`.
- SSH profiles validate structurally but execution stays intentionally non-executable in `PGL4` and returns an explicit `not-implemented` result instead of attempting network access.
- No product-facing code, runtime behavior, or calculator-visible surfaces changed.

## Commits
- Recorded in the current `HEAD` checkpoint with message `chore(playground): capture visibility roadmap and external compute foundations`.

## Memory Updated
- `.memory/current-state.md`
- `.memory/decisions.md`
- `.memory/open-questions.md`
- `.memory/journal/2026-04-14.md`
- `.memory/research/TRACK-PGL3-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
- `.memory/research/playground-incubation-roadmap.md`
- `.memory/sessions/2026-04-14__track-pgl4-external-compute-foundations/completion-report.md`

- `.memory/sessions/2026-04-14__track-pgl4-external-compute-foundations/commit-log.md`

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether the next external-compute incubation step should be a first real SSH/provider pilot or another local-only refinement around budgets, retries, and artifact comparison.
