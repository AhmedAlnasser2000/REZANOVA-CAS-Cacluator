## Automated Gate
- `npm run test:gate`

## Focused Coverage Added / Updated
- `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts`
  - two-step non-periodic chain solving
  - inversion-to-trig handoff
  - inversion-to-PRL handoff
  - explicit depth-cap stops
  - explicit numeric-guidance messaging for unresolved periodic/deep-branch composition families
- `src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
  - visible `Outer Inversion` + `Nested Recursion` provenance
  - preserved domain conditions after chained inversion
  - honest unresolved messaging for periodic/deep-branch stops
- `e2e/qa1-smoke.spec.ts`
  - two-step non-periodic composition smoke
  - inversion-to-trig handoff smoke
  - inversion-to-PRL handoff smoke
  - recognized-but-unresolved periodic/deep-branch smoke

## Outcome
- Passed

## Notes
- The full repo gate passed after adding the composition depth cap, supported-family handoff, and `Nested Recursion` provenance.
- Existing Compute Engine stderr noise still appears in some trig-heavy tests, but assertions passed and the gate is green.
