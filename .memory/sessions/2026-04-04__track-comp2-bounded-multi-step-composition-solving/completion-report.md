## Delivered
- Promoted composition nesting to an explicit guarded policy with a hard cap of two successful outer inversions per solve attempt.
- Added multi-step non-periodic outer inversion so chained composition equations can recurse through the existing guarded backend.
- Added supported-family handoff after inversion into the already-shipped bounded trig, PRL, and algebra solve families when the remaining branch set stays finite and honest.
- Added explicit `Nested Recursion` provenance and explicit numeric-guidance stops for recognized periodic/deep-branch composition families that remain outside bounded exact symbolic scope.

## Main Files
- `src/lib/equation/composition-stage.ts`
- `src/types/calculator/runtime-types.ts`
- `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts`
- `src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- `e2e/qa1-smoke.spec.ts`

## Notes
- `COMP2` is Equation-first only.
- Composition depth is capped at two successful outer inversions.
- Supported-family handoff is allowed only when the downstream bounded solver still produces a finite honest result set.
- Broader periodic-family synthesis, inverse-trig outers, and open-ended multi-layer composition remain deferred.
