## Task Goal
- Deliver Track D `D3` Statistics diagnostics:
  - bounded regression quality summary
  - bounded correlation quality summary
  - no new Statistics subscreens or prediction/inferential-regression scope

## What Changed
- Added a reusable result-card detail-section contract to display compact diagnostic sections below the main result body.
- Extended Statistics regression with:
  - `SSE`
  - residual variance / `MSE` when `n >= 3`
  - residual standard error when `n >= 3`
  - balanced warnings for low sample size and weak/moderate fit
- Extended Statistics correlation with:
  - `Quality Summary` interpretation lines
  - balanced low-sample and weak/moderate fit warnings
- Updated Statistics guide content to explain residual-size diagnostics and non-causal correlation wording.
- Added Track D D3 manual verification checklist artifact.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --run`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `cargo check`

## Commits
- Pending explicit user approval.

## Follow-Ups
- Run the in-app Track D D3 checklist and append pass/fail notes.
- Decide whether to commit this Statistics gate or switch to the next roadmap track.
