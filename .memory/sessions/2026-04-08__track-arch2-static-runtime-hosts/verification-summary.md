# ARCH2 Verification Summary

- Date: `2026-04-08`
- Milestone: `ARCH2 — Promote ARCH1 Seams into Static Runtime Hosts`
- Result: pass

## Focused Checks
- `npm run lint -- src/lib/kernel/capabilities.ts src/lib/kernel/runtime-hosts.ts src/lib/kernel/capabilities.test.ts src/lib/equation/guarded/run.ts src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.ts src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts src/lib/math-engine.ts src/lib/math-engine.test.ts`
- `npm run test:unit -- src/lib/kernel/capabilities.test.ts src/lib/math-engine.test.ts src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/calculate.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts src/app/logic/primaryActionRouter.test.ts src/app/logic/runtimeControllers.test.ts`

## Full Gate
- `npm run test:gate`

## Notes
- The full gate included:
  - unit tests
  - UI tests
  - Playwright E2E
  - lint
  - `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- The only ARCH2-specific regression during implementation was a missing compatibility re-export for `listGuardedEquationStageDescriptors` from `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.ts`; after restoring that stable export path, the focused suite and full gate both passed.
