## Delivered
- Added bounded reciprocal trig composition support for `sec`, `csc`, and `cot` by rewriting into the existing `sin/cos/tan` composition and periodic-family machinery.
- Added principal-range-aware canonical reduction for bounded inverse/direct trig forms like `\arctan(\tan(g(x)))` when the inner carrier is provably inside the selected unit's principal range.
- Extended periodic-family metadata and result rendering with principal-range summaries, piecewise exact branches, reduced-carrier notes, and structured stop reasons.
- Kept deeper inverse/direct trig follow-on honest by stopping with structured guidance when the next exact step would require a second periodic parameter or broader sawtooth-style closure.

## Notes
- `COMP6` stays Equation-only and real-domain only.
- Reciprocal trig is solver-supported now, but real-browser MathLive entry for reciprocal commands is still narrower than the underlying solver/runtime path.
- Browser smoke for this milestone therefore focuses on the stable principal-range and structured-guidance cases, while reciprocal trig remains covered in unit and UI automation.
