## Automated Gate
- `npm run test:gate`

## Focused Coverage Added / Updated
- `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts`
  - reciprocal trig periodic-family success and range rejection
  - principal-range exact reduction for `arctan(tan(cos(x)))=1`
  - structured inverse/direct trig stop for `arcsin(sin(tan(x)))=1/2`
- `src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
  - reciprocal rewrite rendering
  - principal-range/piecewise result sections
  - structured reduced-carrier stop rendering
- `e2e/qa1-smoke.spec.ts`
  - degree-mode principal-range browser smoke
  - structured inverse/direct trig browser guidance smoke

## Outcome
- Passed

## Notes
- The full repo gate passed after the COMP6 solver/runtime/UI changes.
- Reciprocal trig remains browser-visible through solver/runtime behavior, but real-browser MathLive command entry for reciprocal commands is still narrower than jsdom/unit paths, so the stable browser smoke is currently centered on principal-range and structured-guidance flows.
