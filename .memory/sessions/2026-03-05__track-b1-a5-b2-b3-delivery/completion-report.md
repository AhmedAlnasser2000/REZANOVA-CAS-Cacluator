## Task Goal
- Deliver the decision-complete roadmap sequence: `B1 -> A5 -> B2/B3`.

## What Changed
- Implemented bounded affine trig equation matching/solving for:
  - `sin(kx+b)=c`, `cos(kx+b)=c`, `tan(kx+b)=c`
  - linear wrappers `a*f(kx+b)+d=c`
- Added bounded same-argument mixed linear trig solving:
  - `a*sin(A)+b*cos(A)=c`
- Extended trig substitution carrier matching to accept affine arguments.
- Added bounded log-combine solve family:
  - `ln(u)+ln(v)=c`
  - `log(u)+log(v)=c`
  - with positive-domain constraints for both inner arguments.
- Added new solve metadata:
  - `SolveBadge: 'Log Combine'`
  - `SubstitutionSolveDiagnostics.family: 'log-combine'`
- Updated guide/navigation copy for new bounded scope.
- Added required manual verification checklist files:
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-B1-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-A5-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-B2-B3-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`

## Verification
- `npm test -- --run`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `cargo check`
- Checklist-equivalent app-path gate:
  - `npm test -- --run src/lib/trigonometry/equations.test.ts src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts src/lib/trigonometry/core.test.ts src/lib/trigonometry/rewrite-solve.test.ts src/lib/trigonometry/identities.test.ts src/lib/equation/substitution-solve.test.ts`
  - 6 files passed, 45 tests passed.

## Commits
- `05b9e04 feat(solver): deliver Track B1+A5+B2-B3 bounded solve expansion`

## Follow-Ups
- Three checklist files now include pass/fail evidence from executed app-path tests:
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-B1-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-A5-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-B2-B3-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
- UX cleanup applied for solve-note readability:
  - Removed raw LaTeX wrapper tokens (`\left`, `\right`) from substitution summary text.
  - Added a dedicated `Solve note` block in the result card.
- Additional polish after recording review:
  - removed remaining raw-LaTeX output from trig normalized-equation warning line
  - replaced `φ` glyph in warning text with plain `phi` for consistency/readability
- Track A follow-up for broader log transforms (`ln(u)-ln(v)`, ratio/power forms) remains deferred.

## 2026-03-05 Addendum — B4 + B5
- Implemented `B4`:
  - same-base bounded log combine for `ln`, `log`, and `log_a` (constant numeric base only)
  - mixed-base bounded recognition with change-of-base normalization
  - invalid-base hard block (`base > 0`, `base != 1`)
  - recognized mixed-base unresolved messaging with Equation interval guidance
- Implemented `B5`:
  - bounded two-term trig sum-to-product normalization for `sin/cos` sums/differences
  - exact zero-target branch split solving through shared bounded trig backend
  - recognized unresolved path for non-zero families outside bounded exact solve set
- Solver/readability polish:
  - tightened inline summary sanitization so solve notes avoid raw LaTeX wrappers and control tokens
  - substitution branch outcomes now run candidate/domain filtering against original equations when constraints exist
- Added required manual checklists:
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-B4-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - `.memory/research/TRACK-B5-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
- Verification gate:
  - `npm test -- --run`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `cargo check`
