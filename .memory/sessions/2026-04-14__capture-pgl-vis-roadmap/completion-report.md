## Task Goal
- Capture a new `PGL-VIS` roadmap as a post-`PGL` continuation track so calculator-visible Playground work is explicitly separated from the existing incubation-ladder milestones.

## Gate
- backend

## What Changed
- Added a dedicated post-`PGL` roadmap document in `.memory/research/pgl-vis-roadmap.md`.
- Clarified in the main Playground architecture/roadmap notes that any calculator-visible Playground surface belongs to a separate `PGL-VIS` sequence that starts only after the core `PGL` ladder is complete enough to support it safely.
- Recorded the durable sequencing decision and the remaining visibility-model question in memory.
- Updated the current-state snapshot to reflect that `PGL-VIS` is now captured as a follow-on roadmap, not as part of the current `PGL` milestones.

## Verification
- `npm run test:memory-protocol`

## Verification Notes
- This is a roadmap-and-memory capture only. No product code, runtime behavior, or existing Playground enforcement changed.

## Commits
- Recorded in the current `HEAD` checkpoint with message `chore(playground): capture visibility roadmap and external compute foundations`.

## Memory Updated
- `.memory/current-state.md`
- `.memory/decisions.md`
- `.memory/open-questions.md`
- `.memory/journal/2026-04-14.md`
- `.memory/research/playground-incubation-roadmap.md`
- `.memory/research/pgl-vis-roadmap.md`
- `docs/architecture/playground-incubation-ladder.md`
- `.memory/sessions/2026-04-14__capture-pgl-vis-roadmap/completion-report.md`
- `.memory/sessions/2026-04-14__capture-pgl-vis-roadmap/verification-summary.md`
- `.memory/sessions/2026-04-14__capture-pgl-vis-roadmap/commit-log.md`

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether the first `PGL-VIS` implementation milestone should remain strictly internal/developer-only, or whether a later controlled preview surface is worth planning beyond that.
